1. Multithread the descending winEV
2. Add solution supplement feature
.............................................................
Do we want simulator to reset back to first bet after a bust or keep maxing out? Maybe a feature?
Pattern recognition in descending Win EV
MAIN: We still don't know why some strats are performing better than others.
.............................................................
7/11 Update: Run every permuation through the sim and return what is best.
Everything would have to be profitable (not break even)
Should again terminate once the solution hasn't be updated
Absolutely has to be multithreaded
Maybe even from a small output I will be able to determine what the pattern is.
Should run with 100,000, then run with 1,000,000 if in a range, then maybe even run 5,000,000 if within a closer range.
The simulator also needs to account for surplus wins.
Will probably want to print out best ROI found so progress can be monitored.
